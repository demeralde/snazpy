# snazpy
Simple, robust, and straightforward linting for Python. Inspired by ESLint.

All the Python linters I've tried have been pretty average. They're nothing like ESLint, which I consider a great linter. For instance, they're missing key features such as real-time linting, the rules are a bit buggy, and the rules aren't specific enough in some cases. I figured it's probably easier to just create a new linter instead.

This project is a WIP. It's something I've wanted for a long time, but never got around to building. I currently don't have the capacity to dedicate myself to this, but figured there might be a bunch of people online who are interested. If so, I can contribute where possible. You can contact me via [my portfolio](https://danieljs.tech) if you're keen.

## Features

* Real-time linting, as you type
* Integration with popular editors
* Declarative rule setting (using descriptive names)
* Customisable and neat config file (probably written in Python)
* Easily extensible 
* Robust rules for every edge case to enforce the exact styles you want
* Integration with other linters such as mypy
* Style guides for common libraries such as Django
